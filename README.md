# Tailwind Styled Component

This is an alternative of [styled component](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) using [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).  
Same as the known library, it utilises [tagged template literals](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals).

## How to use it

```
const Section = twd.section`
  w-8 h-8
  text-xl uppercase
  bg-red-500 text-white
`;
```

```
const App = () => {
  return (
    <Section>
    </Section>
  )
}
```
